Agenda-5

Now to train the data open the terminal and set the file location based on the data location

then run this one line code:-


yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data=foldername.yaml epochs=110


model= select the required model 

the n in the model say yolov8n reresents nano those are explained at the version.png
it helps to select the required version based on speed,accuracy etc...

the data in the code represents the file name of the yaml stored file
and epochs value is used to iterate the loop to run over the dataset for train,test,val 
the higher the epochs the better accuracy

the code takes time based on the epochs value and the dataset size 
if more data and more epochs
better accuray
