Agenda-6

after training the model we will get a best.pt file inside the mainfolder (test1) 
if we  train it again we get a new that is last.pt

the difference is the best.pt is the best of all the number of times the data is trained
the last.pt is the lastly trained data

to test the model

use this code


yolo task=detect mode=predict model=runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt source=path/to/your/test/image_or_video



in the model you can eiyher select the best.pt of last.pt file

the data you want to check for results need to be set at source (the location of the data to deploy)

after the testinf we will get the output...
