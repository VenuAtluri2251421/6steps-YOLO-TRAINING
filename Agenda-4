Agenda-4
You need to keep all the files in a folder wherever you want them to (Example test1 for storing the test,train,validate,best,last).
the images and lables files need to be downloaded from the website explained in earlier agenda.

create a text file and add the data as foldername.yaml(used to store the location of these test,train,val)

' # ' represents comments inside the yaml files 
Inside the file:-

# Root path and specific paths for train, validation, and test sets
path: E:/test1              # if path is in localdisk E/test1 folder
train: train/images            # Training images (relative to 'path')
val: valid/images              # Validation images (relative to 'path')
test: test/images              # Test images (relative to 'path')

# Number of classes(based on your number of lables)
nc: 1                          # Only one class

# Class names
names:
  0: test1

end of file

check the names of the files inside the yaml and the files which are saved inside the main folder (example test1).
